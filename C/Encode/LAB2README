ON FASTX WHEN DISPLAYING THE CLEARTEXT BACK IT HAS EXTRA CHARACTERS DUE TO GARBAGE; HOWEVER, ON PUTTY IT DOES NOT SHOW.

FOR A KEY OF 0110 THE FIRST VALUE IS 0, THEN 1, THEN 2, THEN 3, THEN 6, THEN 102.

I ran gdb for bit_encode1 to figure out why my hex cipher had an extra character and figured out that it was taking in a return character. 

The Makefile tool is extremely helpful becuase if we didn't have it I would have to type out everything myself to compile every time or scroll up to the last time I did it.
